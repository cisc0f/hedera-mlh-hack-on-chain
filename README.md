# Hedera MLH Hack-On-Chain Workshop

In this workshop, you will discover how to create a hedera client to work with the test network.
You will then build a transaction to transfer test HBAR to another account.
After the transfer, you will create a mirror node client and query the mirror node to get an account's HBAR balance.

### To run this example:

1. Clone repo, 
2. Set up an .env file with your testnet credentials, 
3. Make sure you're on the main branch
4. Run `npm run start`

If you want to use this code as an exercise, switch to the `start-exercise` branch and complete the <add file name> files.
